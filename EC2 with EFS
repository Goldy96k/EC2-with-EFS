# EC2 with EFS - Multi OS Setup on AWS

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates how to set up a shared file system using Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) and mount it to **three different EC2 instances** running different operating systems — Ubuntu, Red Hat Linux, and Amazon Linux 2. The setup allows all instances to share files via a common EFS mount point.

## 🧰 AWS Services Used
- Amazon EC2 (Ubuntu, Red Hat, Amazon Linux 2)
- Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
- Security Groups
- IAM Role (AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonElasticFileSystemFullAccess)

## 🛠️ Architecture Overview
- One EFS created in a selected VPC and availability zone(s)
- Three EC2 instances launched with different OS types
- EFS is mounted on all three instances using NFS protocol
- Files written from one instance are accessible from all others

## ✅ Steps Followed

1. **Create an EFS File System**
   - Go to AWS Console → EFS → Create file system
   - Select VPC and availability zones (make sure they match EC2 AZs)
   - Use default settings (or custom as needed)

2. **Launch EC2 Instances**
   - Launch 3 EC2 instances:
     - One with Ubuntu
     - One with Red Hat Linux
     - One with Amazon Linux 2
   - Ensure they are in the same VPC and availability zones as the EFS
   - Create or assign a security group allowing **inbound NFS (port 2049)** from EFS and between EC2s

3. **Install NFS Client on Each EC2 Instance**
   - SSH into each EC2 instance and run:
     - **Amazon Linux 2:**
       ```bash
       sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
       ```
     - **Ubuntu:**
       ```bash
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install -y nfs-common
       ```
     - **Red Hat:**
       ```bash
       sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
       ```

4. **Mount the EFS File System**
   - Create a mount directory:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /efs
     ```
   - Mount the EFS (replace `fs-xxxxxxxx` with your EFS ID):
     ```bash
     sudo mount -t efs fs-xxxxxxxx:/ /efs
     ```

5. **Test File Sharing**
   - Create a file in `/efs` directory from one instance:
     ```bash
     echo "Test from Ubuntu" | sudo tee /efs/ubuntu.txt
     ```
   - SSH into other EC2s and check if file is visible:
     ```bash
     ls /efs
     cat /efs/ubuntu.txt
     ```

## 📸 Output
- All instances can see and edit the same files from `/efs`
- Successfully mounted EFS on all three EC2s
- Demonstrated cross-OS file sharing

## 💬 Notes
- Ensure NFS port 2049 is open in security groups
- EFS and EC2s must be in the same region and VPC
